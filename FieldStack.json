We just don\u2019t know which half.\u201d\n\nThat sums up how many companies think about events. Teams know the return is there, the problem is knowing which events deliver that return\u2014and which ones are duds.\n\nI saw this first-hand from sponsoring events in previous roles. Without quality data and insights, it\u2019s almost impossible to make informed decisions about events. \n\nAnd the event industry is starved for quality data:\n\n- Companies don\u2019t know which events to attend or sponsor (and often just go to events at the top of Google search)\n\n- In preparation for an event, companies lack a process for deciding how many\u2014or which\u2014salespeople to send\n\n- Once on the ground, salespeople don\u2019t know which leads will attend or how to get in touch with them\n\n- Following the event, salespeople struggle to turn event contacts into meaningful data points, such as separating qualified from unqualified leads \n\nIn a phrase, events are still a black box for most of the companies that sponsor them. \n\nThis is exactly why my Co-founder R. Stefan Deeran and I created Vendelux. \n\nWe\u2019re giving companies the event data and insights they need to make calculated decisions about event marketing, so that businesses can finally achieve predictable impact through B2B events.\u00a0",

We\u2019re already seeing conflicting news going into the busy holiday season \u2013 for example, retail experts are predicting the slowest seasonal hiring season since 2008. But (in a post I shared a few days ago) you\u2019ll see some of the big names like Amazon, Target, and Macy\u2019s have already announced significant hiring numbers.\u00a0\n \u00a0\n Inflation and economic uncertainty will surely have an impact on consumer spending and retailers\u2019 bottom lines in Q4, but to what extent is still unknown. Shoppers may not be willing to compromise during the holiday season, even though we\u2019re seeing some general cooling in consumer spending.\u00a0\n \u00a0\n Though inflation as a whole continues to slow down, we can\u2019t predict with certainty what that will mean for shoppers and retailers this holiday season.

Specifically, because Costco customers enjoyed digging through multi-product displays to find discounts. It\u2019s a great example of how proximal items can affect the sales of other items.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWe see this all the time with the data from FieldStack, but it\u2019s not just discount or clearance items that see a jump in sales. Sometimes, it sort of happens in the reverse. We\u2019ve seen cases where retailers removed the poor-performing items and the items left behind stopped selling as well. And why is that? Well, with certain kinds of goods, the customer wants to see poorer versions nearby to make them feel better about their purchase.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis is why we encourage retailers to look at the whole picture before dropping SKUs. Most retailers are familiar with SKU optimization where you remove items that are underperforming, but this concept is too narrow and doesn\u2019t take into account how certain items perform together. You don\u2019t want to pull items off the shelf just to find that it has a negative impact on your other SKUs.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen you look at section optimization over SKU optimization, you can determine how different SKUs impact each other and which SKUs should be in each section \u2013 effectively optimizing your entire store.

Leave a good review. That's it. It doesn't have to be lengthy and it doesn't have to be detailed. Be kind and leave them a review wherever they are online. Facebook, Etsy, Instagram, Google ... doesn't matter. A minute out of your day can make a big impact.\n\nLet me tell you how.\n\nSmall businesses and #startups typically don't have the budget to prioritize their #marketing. They rely heavily on organic traffic to bring them new leads or sales. Algorithms are good to businesses with customer engagement and positive reviews.\n\nYou leave a good review and the more likely it is that Google (or other platform) will recommend the business to their next customer. Unfortunately, most people don't bother to leave a review unless they had a negative experience with the company. This can really hurt their visibility.\n\nRemember, a quick review costs nothing but a moment of your time. But it can make a big difference for the business you're reviewing. \n\nPlus, a kind word just might make their day \ud83e\udd70\n\nIf you need me, I'll be off leaving a review for my Etsy order that arrived today. \u2b50\ufe0f 5 stars for sure.\n\n#smallbusiness #kindness #marketingtips #marketingforsmallbusiness",

Long story short - she disrupted the joint in her back leg and dislocated several bones.\n\nThanks to the flexibility and patience of my team at Pathfinders Advertising, I was able to take a half day and get her in for X-rays at her vet\u2019s office. We\u2019re waiting on word from a surgeon now to find out if she\u2019ll need surgery or pain management / physical therapy. As we wait on our options, she\u2019s on strict bed rest and pain meds.\n\nHer \u201chospital bed\u201d is in my home office, right by my desk. Meaning I can get my work done, keep a close eye on her, and be available to my team and vet calls the entire day.

This alienates your audience and makes your post difficult to read.\n\nUse the smallest word that will work. For example, instead of \"commence\" say \"start\". Instead of \"utilize\" say \"use\".\n\nClear, simple language is easier to scan and enjoyable to read.\n\nKey takeaway:\nRead through your copy and shorten your words where you can.

It's how you gain trust and brand awareness.\n\nFor example, a veterinary clinic could write a post about symptoms in dogs that don't require an emergency trip to the vet.\n\nIt seems counterintuitive because you are telling them NOT to visit your clinic, but it helps build trust. When they do need to take their dog to see a vet your clinic will be top of mind.\n\nRule of thumb:\nIf it sounds like a sales pitch or an about page then rethink adding it your blog.\n\n#contentmarketing #marketing #website #veterinarian #writing #blogging",

In fact, it can be downright harmful to your website.\n\nNo matter what industry you\u2019re in, Google is cracking down on keyword stuffing and penalizing sites that use this black hat SEO tactic.\n\nUse keywords where they make sense and write your web copy as you would speak to a real person.\n\nFor example, if you have a family law firm don\u2019t say \u201cdivorce attorney\u201d 50 times in your practice area page. Use it where it makes sense to explain what you do and who you can help.\n\nRule of thumb:\nRead your copy out loud.

I've learned that YoutubeTV plans to limit our NFL streaming experience to just two games at once for the upcoming season. \n\nThis decision has left me feeling a deep sense of unease and longing for the days of unrestricted football enjoyment. \ud83d\udc94\n\nAs a fervent sports enthusiast, my Sundays have always been about the thrill of following multiple NFL games simultaneously. I've cherished the energy of each play, the excitement of switching between screens, and the camaraderie of sharing the experience with friends and family who share my passion for the game. \ud83c\udfc8\n\nSadly, the upcoming season will be different. YouTubeTV's decision to restrict us to two games at once feels like a disheartening prospect. I'm dreading the inevitable task of choosing between the games I love, like being asked to pick a favorite child. \ud83d\udc94\n\nI can already imagine the struggle I'll face each week, trying to decide which two games deserve my  attention. The choices will undoubtedly weigh on my heart, and I worry that I'll feel like I'm betraying the spirit of the sport that has brought me so much joy. How I yearn for the days when my love for the NFL could be celebrated without constraints. \ud83d\ude14\n\nAs I ponder the upcoming season, I grieve for the sense of connection and camaraderie that I'll miss with fellow fans. The lively discussions about the twists and turns of multiple games, the emotional rollercoaster of witnessing incredible plays across the league, and the unity fostered by being part of a larger community \u2013 I fear all of this will be lost. \ud83d\ude22\n\nDeep down, I hope that YouTubeTV will reconsider this limitation before the season begins, allowing us to fully express our love for the NFL once more. \ud83e\udd7a\n\nTo everyone who shares my concerns, know that you are not alone. Our dedication to the sport will remain strong, even in the face of adversity. Though we may face the prospect of watching only two games at a time, our passion for the NFL will not be diminished. Let us stand together and hope that, before the season begins, YouTubeTV will recognize the impact of their decision and return us to the boundless joy that once filled our lives. \ud83d\udc99\ud83c\udfc8\n\n#lighthearted #youtubetv #nfl \n",

Middle-school-aged boys have the maturity and enough life experience to have real discussions about gender-related pressures and the impact this has on them and others.\u201d\n\nMore importantly, they\u2019re given the language to talk about a broader view of manhood \u2015 one in which men can be self-aware and socially conscious. They\u2019re reassured that masculinity isn\u2019t inherently bad and that men can forge healthy, authentic relationships, be vulnerable and seek help when they need it.\n\n#boys #gender #prevention",
