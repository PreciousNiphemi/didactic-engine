On the other hand, inspiration arises from external sources, such as role models, stories of success, or the beauty of the world around us.

Together, motivation and inspiration create a dynamic synergy that empowers us to transform dreams into reality, pushing the boundaries of what we once thought possible.

            "postDetails": "When it comes to event planning, feedback plays a pivotal role in shaping the success of your events.\n\nIt serves as a compass for improvement, a gauge of client satisfaction, and a source of invaluable insights. \n\nHowever, many event planners often miss out on these benefits due to various challenges, including the reluctance to seek feedback and the fear of criticism. \n\nFeedback is crucial in event planning for several reasons:\n\n1. Improvement: Feedback provides insights into what went well and what could be improved in an event. This information is invaluable for making future events even better.\n\n2. Client Satisfaction: Feedback from clients or attendees helps gauge their satisfaction and whether their expectations were met. This is essential for maintaining client relationships and ensuring repeat business.\n\n3. Problem Identification: Feedback can reveal issues or challenges that may have gone unnoticed during the planning and execution of an event. It allows event planners to address these problems promptly.\n\n4. Learning Experience: Constructive feedback offers a learning opportunity for event planners. It helps them refine their skills, avoid mistakes, and grow in their profession.\n\nHowever, not all event planners receive feedback. \n\nThere are several reasons for that:\n\n1. Lack of Solicitation: Event planners may not actively seek feedback from clients or attendees, assuming that feedback will be provided voluntarily. Without requesting feedback, they may miss out on valuable insights.\n\n2. Fear of Criticism: Some event planners may be hesitant to ask for feedback because they fear negative comments. However, constructive criticism can lead to improvement, and avoiding feedback altogether can hinder professional growth.\n\n3. Inadequate Communication: Event planners may not effectively communicate the importance of feedback to their clients or attendees. As a result, people may not feel compelled to provide feedback.\n\n4. Limited Resources: Smaller event planning businesses or independent planners may have limited resources and time to collect and analyze feedback effectively.\n\nTo address these challenges, planners should proactively seek feedback, create user-friendly feedback mechanisms, and communicate the value of feedback in enhancing future events. \n\nAdditionally, they can consider using online surveys, post-event questionnaires, or social media channels to gather feedback more efficiently.\n\nFollow for more event planning strategies, industry insights, and career tips to excel in the event industry!\n\n#eventmanagement #feedback #communications #eventplanning #eventbusiness #businesscoach #eventprofs ",

Showing out, on the other hand, means surpassing expectations, excelling and shining in ways others didn't think were possible.\n\n\ud83c\udf1f Enter Musa Motha, a name that perfectly embodies this spirit. Once a promising football player, Musa's life was forever altered when he was diagnosed with cancer, leading to an amputation of his leg. This could have been a tragic end to his dreams, but instead, it marked an inspiring new beginning.\n\n\ud83c\udfb5 With courage as his compass, Musa found a new passion - music. He didn't just learn to live with his amputation; he transformed it into his superpower. Dancing became his new medium to inspire others, turning personal adversity into a universal message of hope and resilience.\n\n\ud83d\udd25 When Musa danced on stage, the room was ablaze with his spirit. His performance was so impassioned, so raw, and so powerful it rewrote the rules. The judges, moved by his talent and the crowd, had no choice but to change the rules on the spot, sending him directly to the semi-finals.\n\n\ud83d\udcaa Musa Motha is the living embodiment of \"show up and show out.\" His story is a testament to human resilience and the power of transforming pain into a purpose.

The Telco (now Tata Motors) pavilion was huge but wasn\u2019t big enough to accommodate the melee of media, industry execs and politicians waiting to see India\u2019s first truly indigenous car, which went onto the lay the foundation for Tata Motors\u2019s passenger car division.\n \nAmidst smoke, lights and spectacular pirouettes by a Ukrainian ballet troupe, the white dome covering the Indica lifted, like an oyster revealing the pearl within. You could almost hear the audience\u2019s eyes popping and jaws hitting the ground, before they burst into thunderous applause. This was Ratan Tata\u2019s defining moment and he poured out his feelings at the highly charged launch: \u201cThe path we chose was criticised by those who said such a task could not be undertaken by us. Having undertaken that, we now have a car that reflects the dedication and enthusiasm of the entire Telco team of young engineers.\u201d An equally emotional Murasoli Maran, the Heavy Industries minister at the time and a special invitee, called the house of Tatas \u2018the Kohinoor of India\u2019.\n \nI was there as a young journalist on that historic day fighting a mob of photographers all jostling to capture the first glimpse of the car. Today, I am deeply honoured to have spent a quiet afternoon with Ratan Tata, the man behind the Indica to celebrate the 25th anniversary with his baby  and recount stories of this iconic car\u2019s remarkable journey.\n \nIndica production ended in 2018 after 20 years but its legacy can still be seen in some of the Tata cars today which are on display at this year\u2019s Auto Expo. \n \n \n#tataindica #indica #25yearsofIndica #tatamotors #happyanniversary #happy25thanniversary #tatacars #ratantata #autocarindia #autocarprofessional",

There are several reasons not to start, one of them is Fear. I remember when I started I was scared too and still scared :)\n\n- What will others think? What to write\n- How can I talk boast about myself?\n- There are so many experts out there, will they read or watch my videos?\n- I don\u2019t know where to start? Not clear how to go about the flow\n- My English is bad. Will I share the right message?\n\n\ud835\ude20\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude36 \ud835\ude22\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude26 \ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude35 \ud835\ude22\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude26. \ud835\ude10\ud835\ude35 \ud835\ude35\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude2c\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude34 \ud835\ude35\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude2e\ud835\ude26 \ud835\ude22\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude25 \ud835\ude25\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude24\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude31\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude26 \ud835\ude35\ud835\ude30 \ud835\ude34\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude35\n\nLast week, I was sharing the same thing with my students. I told them to just try to write once a day. Write about anything in a note pad or Journal. It could be your day to day activities. You don't have to publish it anywhere. \n\nIn our blogging class, I used to ask them to write a Love Letter to their loved ones with a pen and paper\n\nWriting is like therapy, you will feel good. Try and I am sure my good friend prasant naidu  will add more\n\nAnything to add? Leave a comment\n\n#webmarketingacademy #blogging #digitalmarketing",

His resume was not particularly remarkable. Neither was the way he spoke or the way he dressed, or what he said (during the interview). \n\nWhat was remarkable was the energy he carried. He did not tick all the boxes. But his energy was infectious. \n\nWhen asked a few questions regarding the skill he lacked, he responded with a confident, \u201cgive me two weeks and I will learn\u201d. I have heard that many times. I don't often believe it. But this time it was said with a conviction that was undeniable. \n\nLong story short, he got the job. \n\nLater, this is what he said to me. \u201cRashmi, at the beginning of the week, I promised myself that I will not enter my 40th year without a job.
