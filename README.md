# LinkedIn Profile Extraction

## Overview

This repository contains scripts and logs for extracting LinkedIn profile posts. The extraction process was run from 11am to 3pm Lagos time.

## Extraction Details

- **Profiles Processed:** The script was initially run on 149 profiles. Each profile took about 10 seconds on average to process.
- **Pause Time:** To avoid any bans, a pause of around 10-15 minutes was implemented after each profile extraction.

## Stretching the Limits

In an effort to maximize our extraction capabilities, the process was further stretched within the same time frame and run on about 278 profiles. This led to the discovery that a maximum of 200 profiles can be processed within 60 minutes before a restriction is placed on the account.

## Adjustments and Findings

To stay within the limits and avoid restrictions, the script was updated to run on 50 profiles at a time, followed by a pause of 10-15 minutes before continuing the extraction process. This will be further tested when the restriction on my account is lifted.

## Results

In total, posts from 349 profiles were successfully extracted within the 4-hour time frame.

## Future Work

The process will continue to be monitored and adjustments will be made as necessary to ensure as many profiles as possible can be extracted without encountering any restrictions.
