They provide a wide range of services to meet their community's unique needs of individuals living with vision loss.\n\nTheir sister company, Outlook Nebraska, employs more than 60 visually impaired individuals\u00a0at its Omaha production facility, making it the largest employer of the blind in the region.\u00a0Their employment opportunities for those with vision loss range from customer service and marketing to accounting, human resources, training, information technology, and manufacturing. Their experience shows that\u00a0almost any work environment can be adapted\u00a0to accommodate employees with visual impairment.\n\nEarlier this year, I was invited out to help out with their annual golf event, Tee It Up Fore Sight, which is paired with their Stanley M. Truhlsen, Jr. Blind Golfer Clinic for the visually impaired who are interested in golf. Their on-course challenges during the round definitely gave their participants a very special perspective on the game of golf and visual impairment. \n\nDid I convince you to donate yet?

The first time they've seen my job... \n\nDon't get me wrong, it was not their first choice for how to spend the evening and they let me know more than once, but their questions really took me to first-principle thinking and our conversation afterward was great (plus we got ice cream!). \n\nQuestions we discussed on the way home: \n- \"The girls that were talking... they are the boss?\" \n\"They made their companies? So I could start my own company?\"\n Thank you Jessica Korinek & Jennifer Lea for being representation! (and to Jina, Sally, Marina, Natasha among others in the room!)\n\n- \"Who told them they could start a company?\"\n\n- \"So, are they rich since they own it?\"\n\n- \"Do you learn how to be a founder in school?\" \n\n- And probably most importantly... \"Do all your meetings have cookies and grilled cheese?\"\n\nIn all seriousness, it was a lot of fun to share the experience with them and yes \"founder\" was added to their ever-growing list of \"what do you want to be when you grow up\" alongside teacher, soccer player, superhero, YouTuber, doctor, musician, and artist... \n\nI love entrepreneurship, the ability to create something from nothing but, more importantly, I love opportunity... Opportunity to grow, connect, fail, and learn, and last night reinforced in my mind the need for exposure of opportunity for all our young people. \n\nI often remind myself I don't know what I don't know, and believe if we can help make the \"unknown unknown\" - known for more young people and have more of these first-principle conversations about what opportunities are available for you \"to grow up and be\" I believe the possibilities for growth here are limitless. \n\nI'm very excited about the future when we are working together.
