In other words, when I see something not being done right, my first reaction isn\u2019t to go fix it. It\u2019s to say, we\u2019re building a team here. And we\u2019re going to do great stuff for the next decade, not just the next year, and so what do I need to do to help so the person that\u2019s screwing up learns\u2013versus 'how do I fix the problem.'\"\n\nLeadership starts with articulating a future motivating state that your team believes in. \n\nYou have to make it so that  they see themselves in this vision, that they play a role in making it come to life. \n\nThe lessons Steve Jobs shares with us is to believe in the potential of people and work with them to grow into that person. \n\nCoach. Collaborate. Enlighten. Mentor. Encourage. Support\n\nDon't step in to fix things. This disheartens people and tears down their confidence, hope, and ambition.\n\nUnderstand...\nBuild people up.\nLet them try.\nShare lessons, but let them give their best.\nWhen mistakes are made, let them learn and grow.\n\nThis is EQ in motion. You also teach people to take the longer-term view with others...\n\n\n#leadership #innovation #leader #motivationalspeaker #motivational  #inspirational ",

If I've been a donor to you for years and you send me a letter with the phrase \"if you are a donor to us...\" that's an insult and it's downright lazy. \n\nIt doesn't take a fancy database to run a simple \"donor/non-donor\" merge.  Even Excel can sort this way. If you can find the staff person to print the letters, then you can do this simple segmentation.  Because if you don't know whether I'm a donor to you, you won't miss me.\n\n#Fundraising should never be assumed. It is earned and built on trust and relationships.  So, in the rush to get those Giving Tuesday promotions, e-appeals, and print appeals out the door, stop and look to see if you are speaking to your audience in a way that shows you know who they are. There are many reasons why #donor retention is below 50% and this is definitely one of them.\n\n#powerupyourfundraising\n",
