I was lied to, and I had a miserable experience.\n\nI had moved from the Portland area to Bend, 144 miles away, for a very promising and exciting job, with full benefits. I had to take my family around to appointments before 5, and we had a lot of catching up to do. My oldest daughter had to have emotional and mental therapy for a terrible incident that happened to her when she was 7, and she never got any help because I couldn\u2019t afford it until I got that job.\n\nI kept my team apprised of things and all seemed well until my boss chewed me out for not having enough \u201ccommitment\u201d to the company. Sometimes I\u2019d take an hour lunch to run errands and spend a bit more time with my family, as I lived two blocks from my work site. I would always attempt to make up any lost time on the weekends working from home.\n\nI don\u2019t want to name the company or the individual, but they fired me shortly thereafter for vague \u201cperformance issues\u201d.

I pose the question, what is life when you don\u2019t have any time for \u201cyou\u201d or the things you find important?\u00a0I am a father of 4 boys, I run a company, and a work/life balance is the difference between being a great dad or a crappy dad just as much as it\u2019s the difference between being a great business leader and a bad business leader. \n \nI've learned a lot from my experiences outside the US corporate system, especially when looking at and working within the Scandinavian way of life and I am sorry to say, that we need to do better here in the US. We need to find ways to work efficiently, to not \u201cburn out\u201d ourselves and our teams, and to find ways to deliver great products but never sacrifice a positive work/life balance. I have found that if you provide a work environment where people feel trusted, and respected and are given the flexibility to take care of \u201clife\u201d whenever things come up, those people will become invested and passionate about the company they are part of and they are given an environment they can thrive in. Sure, I am guilty of leaving at 3 pm to pick up my kids from football or heading out at 11:30 am to take my son to the dentist, I know my team does the same and they feel comfortable doing so but I also know they care about our project, the company, deliverables and their job. \n \nI guess the point is that we need to optimize business while providing a great balance for our people. We are all people, people with families, and people with responsibilities\u2026focus on the people and they will focus back.\n#worklifebalance #gamedev #bebetter #dobetter #peoplefirst\u00a0",

I am in awe of the resources people are generously offering. \n\nLast week I started the Aspireship SaaS Foundations in Sales course - it comes with the free trial and I am excited by not only how thorough an introduction it is but how manageable it is to work through. It is a great way to learn not just about sales but about what it means to run a business in general!\n\nThe course helps me see that my experience in education could be so beneficial in a SaaS sales position. As #educators we are goal-oriented, our success is based in knowing our customers through and through - and empathizing with them. We have to be organized and mission-driven. Educators are always learning, tweaking, and asking for help. We have to know our product and be passionate about it. We have to be curious about the problems our customer is experiencing and interested in how we can help solve it. *We have to lead the customer* \n\nIs this what I want to direct my pivot towards? I don't know yet! But I am enjoying learning about it and I know that is a step! \n\nAny #edtech and #saassales reps willing to share with #transitioningteachers what you love about your job?",
